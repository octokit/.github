- [C# / .NET](https://github.com/octokit?q=&type=all&language=c%23&sort=)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/octokit?q=&type=all&language=ruby&sort=)
- [Terraform provider](https://github.com/integrations/terraform-provider-github)

If you're new here, please take a moment to get familliar with how our communities get stuff done - hopefully you'll consider being part of the amazing things happening here.
If you're already a contributor we can't thank you enough for being part of making our communities what they are!  Thank you for all that you do.

## Code of conduct

Open source projects can be amazing things and while the source code they provide is an important component of the project 
it's definitely not the only thing that makes it amazing... you are! 

Practice kindnes, be welcoming, and always assume that we all have something to learn. Take a minute to read more about our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing

While each community in our collection of Octokit communities is unique and have some really great nuances we have standard approaches across all of our repos
to lower barriors to entry and reduce the friction of getting things done. Make sure to have a look at each of the repositorie's `CONTRIBUTING` docs above when 
making contributions. Oh, and thanks for being amazing and helping to both improve our communities and code! ‚ù§Ô∏è

[^1]:Official just means GitHub and folks from GitHub support and maintain these libraries on an ongoing basis.
